## Missing Information

### No Author

Move title to author position:

**Reference:**
```
Title of article. (Year). *Journal Name, Volume*(Issue), Page-Page.
```

**In-text:**
- Parenthetical: ("Shortened Title," Year)
- Narrative: "Shortened Title" (Year)

Use italics for standalone works (books, reports), quotation marks for articles.

### No Date

Use `n.d.` (no date):

**Reference:**
```
Author, A. A. (n.d.). Title of work. Publisher. https://url
```

**In-text:** (Author, n.d.)

### No Title

Provide bracketed description:

**Reference:**
```
Author, A. A. (Year). [Description of work]. Source. https://url
```

**In-text:** (Author, Year)

### No Page Numbers (for direct quotes)

Use alternative locators:
- Paragraph: `(Author, Year, para. 4)`
- Section heading: `(Author, Year, Methods section)`
- Section + paragraph: `(Author, Year, Results section, para. 2)`
- Timestamp (video/audio): `(Author, Year, 2:15)`
- Slide number: `(Author, Year, Slide 7)`

### Multiple Missing Elements

Combine solutions:
```
[Description of work]. (n.d.). Retrieved Month Day, Year, from https://url
```
In-text: ("[Description]," n.d.)

---

## Author Variations

### Group/Organization Author

**First citation:** Spell out full name, add abbreviation if well-known
```
(American Psychological Association [APA], 2019)
American Psychological Association (APA, 2019)
```

**Subsequent citations:** Use abbreviation
```
(APA, 2019)
APA (2019)
```

**Reference list:** Always full name (never abbreviation)

### Author with Suffix (Jr., III)

Include suffix in reference but not in-text:

**Reference:**
```
King, M. L., Jr. (1963). *Letter from Birmingham jail*. Publisher.
```

**In-text:** (King, 1963)

### Username as Author (social media)

Use username without brackets when real name unknown:
```
PsychToday [@PsychToday]. (2023, June 15)...
```

When real name known:
```
Gates, B. [@BillGates]. (2023, March 21)...
```

### Anonymous Author

Use "Anonymous" ONLY if work is explicitly signed "Anonymous":
```
Anonymous. (Year). *Title*. Publisher.
```
In-text: (Anonymous, Year)

If author simply unknown, use title in author position.

### 21+ Authors

List first 19 authors, ellipsis, then final author:
```
Author, A. A., Author, B. B., Author, C. C., Author, D. D., Author, E. E.,
    Author, F. F., Author, G. G., Author, H. H., Author, I. I., Author, J. J.,

```

---

## Date Variations

### Approximate Date

Use `ca.` (circa):
```
Author, A. A. (ca. 1900). *Title*. Publisher.
```

### Date Range

For works published over time:
```
Author, A. A. (2019-2021). *Title*. Publisher.
```

### In Press/Forthcoming

Use `in press`:
```
Author, A. A. (in press). Title. *Journal Name*.
```
In-text: (Author, in press)

### No Date vs. Unknown Date

- Use `n.d.` when publication has no date
- For older works where date is uncertain, use `ca.` with approximate year

---

## Secondary Sources

When citing a source you found within another source (and cannot access the original).

**Best practice:** Always try to locate and cite the original source.

**When original unavailable:**

**In-text:**
```
Rabbitt's study (as cited in Lyon et al., 2014)
(Rabbitt, 1982, as cited in Lyon et al., 2014)
```

**Reference list:** Include ONLY the source you actually read (Lyon et al., 2014)

---

## Personal Communications

Includes: emails, text messages, phone calls, personal interviews, unrecorded lectures, letters, memos.

**In-text only** (not recoverable, so not in reference list):
```
(J. Smith, personal communication, January 15, 2023)
J. Smith (personal communication, January 15, 2023) stated...
```

Include:
- Initials and surname
- Exact date (as specific as possible)

### Research Participant Quotes

Do NOT cite as personal communication. Present as part of methodology/results with pseudonyms for confidentiality.

---

## Translated and Non-English Works

### Translated Work

```
Author, A. A. (Year). *Title in English* (T. Translator, Trans.). Publisher.
    (Original work published Year)
```

**In-text:** (Author, original year/translation year)
Example: (Freud, 1923/1961)

### Work in Original Language (with English translation)

```
Author, A. A. (Year). *Title in original language* [English translation of
    title]. Publisher.
```

### Your Own Translation

Treat as paraphrase (not direct quote), cite original source.

---

## Republished and Reprinted Works

### Republished Book

```
Author, A. A. (Year). *Title*. Publisher. (Original work published Year)
```
In-text: (Author, original year/republished year)

### Work in Anthology

```
Author, A. A. (Year). Title of work. In E. Editor (Ed.), *Title of anthology*
    (pp. xx-xx). Publisher. (Original work published Year)
```
In-text: (Author, original year/anthology year)

---

## Retracted and Corrected Articles

### Citing Retracted Article (the content)

```
Author, A. A. (Year). Title. *Journal, Volume*(Issue), Page-Page.
    https://doi.org/xxxxx (Retraction published Year, *Journal, Volume*, Page)
```

### Citing Retraction Notice

```
Editor, E. E. (Year). Retraction notice for "Title of article." *Journal,
    Volume*(Issue), Page. https://doi.org/xxxxx
```

### Corrected Article

Cite the corrected version normally; no need to note correction.

---

## Works in Progress

```
Author, A. A. (Year). *Title* [Manuscript submitted for publication].
    Department, University.
```

### Manuscript in Preparation

```
Author, A. A. (Year). *Title* [Manuscript in preparation]. Department,
    University.
```

### Preprint

```

Note preprint status in text if relevant: "Smith et al. (2023) found... [preprint]"

---

## Database and URL Rules

### When to Include Database Name

**DO NOT include** for common databases:
- JSTOR
- EBSCO
- ProQuest (except dissertations)
- Academic Search Complete
- PubMed
- PsycINFO

**DO include** for:
- ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global
- Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews
- University archives/repositories
- Sources available only in one database

### When to Include URLs

- **Include** if source has no DOI and was accessed on open web
- **Omit** if accessed through library database with no DOI
- **DOI always preferred** over URL when available

### URL vs. DOI

If source has both, include only DOI.

### Retrieval Dates

Include ONLY for content that may change:
- Online dictionaries
- Social media profiles
- Unarchived webpages
- Google Maps

**NOT needed for:**
- Wikipedia (archived)

---

## Same Author/Same Year

When an author has multiple works from the same year:

1. **Alphabetize by title** in reference list (ignore a, an, the)
2. **Add lowercase letters** after year

**Reference list:**
```
Smith, J. (2023a). Cognitive development in adolescents...
Smith, J. (2023b). Social influences on learning...
```

**In-text:**
```
(Smith, 2023a)
(Smith, 2023b)
```

---

## Multiple Sources in One Citation

### Basic Rule

Alphabetize by first author, separate with semicolons:
```
(Adams, 2020; Chen, 2019; Williams et al., 2021)
```

### Same Author, Multiple Works

Give author once, list years chronologically:
```
(Zhang, 2018, 2020, 2023)
```

With no date:
```
(Zhang, n.d., 2020, 2023)
```

### Emphasizing Key Sources

Put most relevant first, then "see also":
```
(Sampson & Hughes, 2020; see also Augustine, 2017; Melara et al., 2018)
```

---

## Classical and Religious Works

### Religious Texts

Title to author position (no author for sacred texts):
```
King James Bible. (2017). King James Bible Online.
    https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/ (Original work published 1769)
```

**In-text:** Use canonical numbering
```
(King James Bible, 1769/2017, 1 Cor. 13:1)
```

### Classical Works

Use standard numbering systems:
```
(Shakespeare, 1623/2003, 1.5.45-60)    [Act.Scene.Lines]
(Aristotle, trans. 1931, 1.3.25)        [Book.Chapter.Line]
(Plato, trans. 1925, 360b)              [Stephanus numbers]
```

---

## Legal Materials

APA defers to The Bluebook for legal citations. Key formats:

### Court Cases
```
Name v. Name, Volume Source Page (Court Year). URL
```
In-text: *Brown v. Board of Education* (1954)

### Statutes
```
Name of Act, Title Source § Section (Year). URL
```

### Executive Orders
```
Exec. Order No. XXXXX, 3 C.F.R. Page (Year). URL
```

---

## Self-Citation

### Citing Your Own Previous Work

Treat yourself as author, work as unpublished manuscript:
```
Your Name. (Year). *Title of paper* [Unpublished manuscript]. Department,
    Institution.
```

### In-Text Self-Reference

Third person (preferred):
```
Previous research by this author showed... (Johnson, 2024)
```

First person (reflective writing):
```
In my previous research, I found... (Johnson, 2024)
```

### Avoiding Self-Plagiarism

Per APA Manual (p. 21):
1. Get approval to reuse portions of prior work
2. Provide proper citation
3. Do not submit entire previous papers as new
