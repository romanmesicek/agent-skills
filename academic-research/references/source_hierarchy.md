# Source Priority Hierarchy

## Priority Levels

| Priority | Type | Reliability | When to Use |
|----------|------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | Peer-reviewed journals | Highest | Primary evidence, core claims |
| 2 | Journal articles/preprints | High | Supporting evidence, recent findings |
| 3 | Theses/working papers | Medium-High | Specialized topics, emerging research |
| 4 | Independent organizations | Medium | Statistics, policy context |
| 5 | Company/industry reports | Medium-Low | Market data (note bias) |
| 6 | Other web sources | Low | Background only, requires verification |

## Domain Classification Patterns

### Priority 1: Peer-Reviewed Journals

acs.org, ieee.org, acm.org
```

### Priority 2: Journal Articles/Preprints
```

## Uncertainty Markers

Apply these annotations to findings:

| Marker | Meaning | When to Use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `[UNVERIFIED]` | Single source | Claim from one source only |
| `[CONFLICTING]` | Sources disagree | Multiple sources with different conclusions |
| `[INDUSTRY SOURCE]` | Potential bias | Data from company with commercial interest |
| `[OUTDATED]` | May be stale | Source >5 years in fast-moving field |
| `[PREPRINT]` | Not peer-reviewed | From arXiv, bioRxiv, SSRN, etc. |
| `[SECONDARY]` | Primary not accessed | Citing another source's citation |

## Verification Requirements

### Priority 6 Sources (Other Web)
Before citing, verify:
1. Author credentials (expertise in field)
2. Publication date (recency)
3. Cross-reference claims with Priority 1-4 sources
4. Check for potential commercial bias
5. Look for primary source citations

### Conflicting Sources
When sources disagree:
1. Note the conflict explicitly
2. Weight by priority level
3. Consider recency
4. Check methodology differences
5. Present both viewpoints if unresolvable
